      <h1>Well, I got better.</h1>

      <p>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Where'd you get the coconuts?</p>
      <p>She looks like one. And the hat. She's a witch! <strong> Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</strong> <em> Why do you think that she is a witch?</em> Who's that then?</p>

      <h2>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</h2>

      <p>I am your king. Did you dress her up like this? Burn her! The nose? Why do you think that she is a witch?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>
        <li>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</li>
        <li>I have to push the pram a lot.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</h3>

      <p>Burn her! Oh, ow! Well, we did do the nose. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li>
        <li>Well, she turned me into a newt.</li>
        <li>Shut up!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>She looks like one. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Who's that then? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
      <p>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. It's only a model. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.</p>
      <p>You don't vote for kings. Bloody Peasant! Where'd you get the coconuts? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? I am your king. Did you dress her up like this?</p>
      <p>I am your king. Did you dress her up like this? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
      <p>Well, we did do the nose. Who's that then? What a strange person. I dunno. Must be a king. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
      <p>Well, we did do the nose. You don't vote for kings. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Burn her! Bring her forward!</p>
      <p>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, I got better. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!</p>
      <p>Bring her forward! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!</p>
      <p>Where'd you get the coconuts? Be quiet! I dunno. Must be a king. Now, look here, my good man.</p>
      <p>Camelot! Camelot! Did you dress her up like this? I am your king. How do you know she is a witch?</p>
      <p>Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
